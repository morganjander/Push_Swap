# Push_Swap
## Aim 1: Create a program **Push_Swap** that will print out instructions to sort a given stack of integers in ascending order, choosing from just the following moves:
* **pa** push the top first element of stack a to stack b
* **pb** push the top first element of stack b to stack a
* **sa** swap first two elements of stack a
* **sb** swap first two elements of stack b
* **ss** execute **sa** and **sb**
* **ra** rotate stack a (the first element becomes the last)
* **rb** rotate stack b
* **rr** execute **ra** and **rb**
* **rra** reverse rotate a (the last element becomes the first)
* **rrb** reverse rotate b
* **rrr** execute **rra** and **rrb**

## Aim 2: Create a program **Checker** that will execute instructions and check whether or not they sort the stack
